What?
============
TinySU is a tiny alternative for [Chainfire's SuperSU](http://www.supersu.com) or [PHH's SuperUser](https://superuser.phh.me) or [MagiskSU](https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3473445)


Why?
===========
These all major root management solutions are currently, in my own opinion, too bloated.

I need something **very** simple on my G930U. No fancy options. Something like

```bash
adb push su /system/bin
adb install TinySU.apk
```

No systemless thingie at the moment, yet.
Oh, and TinySU  will be compatible with the famous [libsuperuser](https://github.com/Chainfire/libsuperuser)

How?
===========


Still thinking :D
